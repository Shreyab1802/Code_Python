# You are given a board of N rows and M columns. Each field of the board contains a single digit (0âˆ’9).
#
# You want to find a path consisting of four neighboring fields. Two fields are neighboring if
# they share a common side. Also, the fields in your path should be distinct (you can't visit the same field twice).
#
# The four digits of your path, in the order in which you visit them, create an integer.
# What is the biggest integer that you can achieve in this way?
#
# Write a function
#
# class Solution { public int solution(int[][] Board); }
#
# that, given the board represented as a matrix of integers consisting of N rows and M columns,
# returns the biggest integer that you can achieve when concatenating the values in a path of length four.
#
# Examples:
#
# Given the following board (N=3, M=5):
# the function should return 9121. You can choose either
# of the following paths (the first field is denoted by red):
